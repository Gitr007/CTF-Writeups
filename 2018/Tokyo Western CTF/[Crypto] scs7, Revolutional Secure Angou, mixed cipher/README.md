`e*q = 1 (mod p)` implies that `e*q = k*p + 1` (1). Since `q < p`, we know that `k < e = 65537`. So, just brute-force `k` until we find a solution to the equation `e*n = k * p^2 + p` (2). Notice that (2) is (1) with both side multiplied by `p`.

### mixed cipher

(_233 pt, 39 solves_)

You need to:
-   Look for some multiples of the modulus `n`, then calculate the GCD to get `n`.
-   Learn how to decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts, given an RSA LSB(s) oracle, to get the AES key.
-   Learn how to untwist the Mersenne Twister (the `random` module's core PRNG) to predict the IV used to encrypt the flag.
