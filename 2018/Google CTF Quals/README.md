### Crypto

#### BETTER ZIP

(_231 pt, 38 solves_)

Basic steps:

1. Reverse the LFSR, in other words, recover all possible `poly`'s, given the `iv` and some output.
2. Extract `encrypted_data`, `key_iv`, `cipher_iv` from the ZIP file given. If you don't want to examine the ZIP headers, just modify the source code to let it print out the offsets while packing the data and then, run a test.
3. Using the `cipher_iv`, restore the first 20 bytes of the original PNG file.
4. Learn the PNG format to guess the next 20 bytes or more of the original PNG file. You may want to edit an image with MS Paint and save it in PNG format.
5. For each guess, derive the output of the 8 LFSRs, reverse them, recover the key, decrypt the `encrypted_data` and check if it is valid.

#### MITM

(_243 pt, 34 solves_)

Basic steps:

1. Send the little-endian byte representation of `2^255 - 19` as public key during the handshakes with both the server and the client since in the integers mod `2^255 - 19`, `0` and `2^255 - 19` are the same but the `2^255 -19` public key is not rejected by the vulnerable handshake protocol. More on [curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) and the [implementation](http://cr.yp.to/ecdh/curve25519-20051115.pdf) used by the challenge.

    Now, you know the `sharedKey` between the parties. It's time to authenticate.

2. Forward the server's nonce to the client.
3. Forward the client's proof to the server.

    Now, you're authenticated and should be able to get the flag.
